# Optimisation of Revenue and Customer Base Expansion Process of a Local Vegetable Seller
Business Data Management Project

## Introduction
* For the purpose of this project, I have chosen a local fruits and vegetables vendor in my locality, who is in the business of perishable goods
* He purchases and sells fruits and vegetables across multiple adjacent localities, however the primary market presently is in my locality, Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi.
* Currently, he sells to apartment/bungalow owner families, slum area families and restaurants in the locality
* Key problems faced by the business are:
   * Niche customer base which is facing competition from online suppliers. This has created a barrier to generate more revenues
   * Potential stock wastages and monetary mismanagement, due to unorganized way of bookkeeping

## Analysis Methodology & Tools Used
* Pivot Tables, VLookup, Filters, and the sorting function have been essential tools for my study since they have made it much easier to grasp the data in a categorical way.
* Use of pictorial charts such as Clustered Column Chart and Pie Chart has helped me to see how well the Pareto Analysis is being followed by the business
* Python Libraries such as Pandas, MatPlotLib and Seaborn have been used in the Heatmap Analysis
* Using AVERAGEIF() has helped me to collate opening, closing stock along with sales and purchase to calculate the average days of inventory
* Also, Line Chart and Bubble Chart have been used to understand the patterns of stock usage

## Is Pareto Analysis being followed for Revenue and Volume?

## Day Wise Patterns and Trends

## HeatMap Analysis - Correlation between Days

## Inventory Analysis

## Conslusion and Findings
* Clearly, expansion of customer base (volume of sales) is crucial to survive in this business given the variables involved, and increase revenues
* Should also go and sometimes personally deliver items if possible, so as to build the connection and familiarity with the customer. One place where he can make up for price is high level customer service
* Must incorporate asking door to door recommendations from his customers, as that can help immensely in creating a personalised relationship with the customer
* Inaccurately predicting revenues and buying more items might result in significant losses that harm the business, so make sure to avoid those
* After these processes are implemented, he can surely make investments in fixed assets such as a delivery scooter/mini truck and a refrigerator for cold storage.

## Data Confidentiality
The data has been kept confidential due to it being of a private business, the data has been exclusively shared with the grading authority for this project i.e. Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
