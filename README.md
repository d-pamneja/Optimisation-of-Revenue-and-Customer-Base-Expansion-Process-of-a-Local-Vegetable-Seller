# Optimisation-of-Revenue-and-Customer-Base-Expansion-Process-of-a-Local-Vegetable-Seller
Business Data Management Project

## Introduction
* For the purpose of this project, I have chosen a local fruits and vegetables vendor in my locality, who is in the business of perishable goods
* He purchases and sells fruits and vegetables across multiple adjacent localities, however the primary market presently is in my locality, Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi.
* Currently, he sells to apartment/bungalow owner families, slum area families and restaurants in the locality
* Key problems faced by the business are:
 * Niche customer base which is facing competition from online suppliers. This has created a barrier to generate more revenues
 * Potential stock wastages and monetary mismanagement, due to unorganized way of bookkeeping
